I want to learn your watering can preferences

To be more precise, I'm trying to find out whether I can learn about your watering can preferences by treating this online store as a species of living shops. In technical terms, an artificial life type selection mechanism drives a genetic programming core which evolves the SQL-queries that result in the products you are looking at. Darwinism in action, baby.

To participate in the experiment, imagine you are in dire need of a watering can. Click products you find interesting and the store adapts to your behaviour. Didn't find anything of your liking? Come back tomorrow: the offering will change based on your interests.

Thanks so much for participating!
